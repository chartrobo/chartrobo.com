    <h1><u>About ChartRobo</u></h1>
    <p>
      <strong>ChartRobo – Stock Market Analysis Academy</strong> is an educational initiative founded by
      <strong>Brajesh Kumar</strong>, an NISM Certified Research Analyst with professional experience
      across banking, finance, and technology.
      <br><br>
      The academy focuses on developing <b>structured, disciplined, and objective market understanding</b>
      rather than prediction-based or emotion-driven approaches.
    </p>

    <h3><u>About the Founder/Educator</u></h3>

    <p>
      <strong>Brajesh Kumar</strong><br>
      <em>NISM Certified Research Analyst | Ex-Banker (Bank of Baroda)</em>
      <br><br>
      With experience spanning banking operations, financial markets, and analytical research,
      Brajesh founded ChartRobo to address a key gap in market education —
      the lack of structured thinking and decision discipline.
      <br><br>
      His teaching approach emphasizes understanding <b>price behavior, market structure,
      and time-based context</b>, helping learners think independently rather than rely on external opinions.
    </p>

    <h3><u>Our Vision</u></h3>
    <p>
      Modern financial markets reward discipline, patience, and structure —
      not emotional reactions or shortcuts.
      <br><br>
      ChartRobo’s vision is to help learners develop a calm, analytical mindset
      while interpreting charts and market behavior objectively.
    </p>

    <h3><u>Our Journey</u></h3>
    <p>
      ChartRobo was created to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge
      and real-market observation.
      <br><br>
      Over years of market study and live observation, the academy’s learning framework
      evolved into a structured approach that combines market structure,
      price behavior, psychology, and time awareness.
    </p>

    <h3><u>Our Philosophy</u></h3>
    <p>
      Markets reflect collective human behavior and follow repeatable structural patterns.
      <br><br>
      By combining <b>psychological awareness</b> with <b>logical market structure</b>,
      ChartRobo helps learners reduce emotional bias and develop clarity in decision-making.
      <br><br>
      We believe successful market participants must
      <b>think objectively, act patiently, and follow process over emotion</b>.
    </p>
