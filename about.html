      <h1><u>About ChartRobo</u></h1>
      <p>
        <strong>ChartRobo</strong> is an <b>educational initiative</b> founded by <strong>Brajesh Kumar</strong> — an NISM Certified Research Analyst with professional experience across finance, banking, and technology.
        The mission is to simplify technical analysis and market psychology into structured, logical frameworks that any learner can understand.
      </p>
        <h3><u>Meet The Founder :</u></h3>

            <p>
                <strong>Brajesh Kumar</strong> — <em>NISM Certified Research Analyst & Ex-Banker (Bank of Baroda)</em><br><br>
                With extensive experience across banking, technology, and financial markets, Brajesh founded <strong>ChartRobo</strong> to simplify trading education. 
                His goal is to help traders focus on structure and disciplined analysis through historical data & price action with intuitive tools and real-market insights.
            </p>
      <h3><u>Our Vision</u></h3>
      <p>
        The modern market rewards discipline, structure, and logic — not emotion.  
        ChartRobo aims to help individuals develop a robotic mindset while interpreting charts, focusing purely on data and structure rather than impulses or tips.
      </p>

      <h3><u>Our Journey</u></h3>
      <p>
        ChartRobo was conceptualized to bridge the gap between theory and practice in trading education.  
        Through years of observation and research, we designed two mathematical, data-based learning tools — 
        <b>ChartRobo Seasonal Trend Analyzer (TradeRadar)</b> and <b>ChartRobo Potential Reversal Finder (WaveX)</b> — both used purely for educational visualization.
      </p>

      <h3><u>Our Philosophy</u></h3>
      <p>
        Markets are driven by crowd psychology and repeatable structures.  
        By combining <b>psychological awareness</b> with <b>mathematical logic</b>, ChartRobo helps learners understand price behavior objectively and eliminate emotional bias.
        We believe every trader should learn to “think like a robot, act like a professional.”
      </p>

      <h3><u>What We Offer</u></h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>ChartRobo Basic Workshop:</strong> Foundational program on psychology, structure, and analytical process.</li>
        <li><strong>ChartRobo Mentorship Program:</strong> Ongoing live discussions, feedback, and learning reinforcement.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Both programs are purely educational and designed to improve understanding of charts, not to provide investment advice or stock recommendations.
      </p>
